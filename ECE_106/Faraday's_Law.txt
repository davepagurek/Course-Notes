====== Faraday's Law ======
Created Friday 27 March 2015

===== Induced Voltage =====
What happens when B is changing with time?
{{./pasted_image.png}}
If linkage changes with time, there is an induced voltage across the circuit.
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}

Assume the circuit is a battery. **TIP: Always assume dl is counterclockwise and ds is up.** If the assumption is wrong, the answer will simply appear negative, indicating that the direction was opposite of what was assumed.

==== Lenz's Law ====
the induced voltage createse a current in a direction such that the induced current tries to oppose the charge in {{./equation002.png?type=equation}}. This is essentially just a restatement of the conservation of energy.

===== Examples =====
1. Calculate the induced voltage
