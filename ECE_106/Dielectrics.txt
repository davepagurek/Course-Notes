===== General Equations =====
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}

Actual Gauss's law:
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}

===== Boundary Conditions =====
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
The tangential components of the electric fields are the same:
{{./equation006.png?type=equation}}

The difference between the normal components times permittivity is the surface charge density:
{{./equation007.png?type=equation}}

===== Examples =====

1. A capacitor is connected to a power supply with voltage V. Once charged, the power supply is remvoed, and a dielectric is placed halfway into the capacitor. Find the charge on the part of the capacitor with the dielectric in it.

Before power source is removed:

After:
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}

{{./equation008.png?type=equation}}

{{./equation009.png?type=equation}}

{{./equation010.png?type=equation}}


2. Two media are side by side. In medium 1, {{./equation011.png?type=equation}} makes an angle of {{./equation012.png?type=equation}} with the normal axis. Calculate {{./equation013.png?type=equation}}.

{{./equation014.png?type=equation}}

Dividing the first equation by the second gives:
